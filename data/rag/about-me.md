# About Saakshi Munot

I am a sophomore at Purdue University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, concentrating in **Machine Intelligence** and **Databases and Information Systems**.  
My work blends AI/ML, full-stack development, and scalable systems — from architecting microservices backends to designing engaging user experiences.  
I have a passion for solving real-world problems, teaching, and building products that improve efficiency, accessibility, and engagement.  
My journey began with replicating the German Enigma machine, sparking my love for cryptography and problem-solving. Since then, I’ve led multiple award-winning projects and contributed to cutting-edge AI applications.
